Current:

I am working with Professor Vida Vakillian, one of the Department Heads of Mechatronics at CSUCI, and the research I am doing is obtaining a better knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC).

So far I have learned:

-   Micro 820 controller with CCW

-   CompactLogix Controller 1769-LI18ER-BB1B with Studio5000

-   How to incorporate SCADA into a PLC system via an internet connection
