I am currently working under Professor Vida Vakillian. She is one of the Department Heads of Mechatronics at CSUCI and the research I am doing is obtaining a better knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC).

So far I have learned:

Micro 820 controller with CCW

CompactLogix Controller 1769-LI18ER-BB1B with Studio5000
